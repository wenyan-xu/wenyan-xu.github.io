My research focuses on the environmental impact on human health, specifically in relation to landscape preference, justice, landscape ecology, and sustainability. I have a strong interest in interdisciplinary research methods. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture at Anhui University of Science and Technology, followed by studies in Environmental Psychology at China University of Mining and Technology. I then pursued research in Geography and Population Health at The University of Hong Kong.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Utah State University, where I investigate the relationship between greenspace morphology and human health under the guidance of Dr. Huaqing Wang. I completed my PhD at The University of Hong Kong, advised by Dr. Bin Jiang and co-advised by Prof. Chris Webster. Additionally, I earned my Master’s degree under the mentorship of Prof. Jingwei Zhao at China University of Mining and Technology.
