Wenyan's research focuses on environmental impact on human health, related to landscape preference and justice, and landscape ecology and sustainability. I am interested in interdisciplinary research methods. I have been trained as landscape architect in Bachelor at AUST, starting study on environmental psychology at CUMT, and taking research on geography science and population health at HKU.
